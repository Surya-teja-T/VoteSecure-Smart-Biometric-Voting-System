VoteSecure – Smart Biometric Voting System

VoteSecure is a secure and modern web-based voting application designed to simulate a biometric-enabled digital voting system. The project demonstrates how votes can be securely selected, encrypted, and stored within a browser environment for demonstration purposes.

Project Overview

This application represents the voting stage of a smart election system where users can select a candidate and submit their vote securely. The vote is encrypted and stored locally in the browser as a demo of secure digital voting concepts.

The system focuses on clean UI design, structured workflow, and simulated encryption to demonstrate how modern online voting platforms may operate.
